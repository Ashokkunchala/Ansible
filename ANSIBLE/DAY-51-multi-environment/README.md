# Day 51 — Multi-Environment Design

## Goal
Separate inventory, group variables and role code for dev/stage/prod without duplication.

## Example
```text
inventories/dev
inventories/stage
inventories/prod
```

## Exercises
1. Implement the pattern from scratch.
2. Add one realistic DevOps variation.
3. Validate syntax and lint.
4. Document verification and rollback.

## Mini challenge
Produce an implementation that another engineer could safely review and operate.

## Production requirements
- No hard-coded secrets.
- Idempotent tasks.
- Clear inventory boundaries.
- Check/diff before changes where appropriate.
- Failure handling and rollback.
- Tests for reusable logic.

## Checklist
- [ ] Implementation complete
- [ ] Validation complete
- [ ] Failure path tested
- [ ] Documentation complete
